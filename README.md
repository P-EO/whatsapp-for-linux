### This script is to install WhatsApp Web as desktop application in Linux.

This script uses [nativefier](https://github.com/nativefier/nativefier) to wrap WhatsApp Web as desktop application in Linux and make a script to delete the `Service Worker` folder to avoid the error like `To use WhatsApp, update Chrome or use Mozilla Firefox, Safari, Microsoft Edge or Opera.` before starting the desktop app.
